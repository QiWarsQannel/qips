QiDao collects repayment fees (0.5% of repaid debt). Currently, 70% is maintained within the treasury, while 30% is sold for QI on the open market and distributed to eQi stakers. 

eQI staking APY has fallen during the bear market. The estimates of the QIP writers, it used to be around 50% or higher for the 4 year lock. It is now around 7% over the past month, which dissuades users from staking and locking their QI - an action that is beneficial for the platform.

We propose that in light of these facts, the DAO will raise the percentage of repayment fees paid to eQI stakers from 30% to 50%. (In the same manner as before: buyback and distribute.)

### Motivation
 
- Make tokenomics of Qi more desirable
- Increase payout to eQi stakers (long-term protocol believers)
- Increase locked Qi amount
- Decrease weekly Qi sold
 
### Quorum Standards 
 
- The option with the most votes will be adopted. 
 
### Options 

- Approve proposal 
- Further discussions needed
