This proposal is to instate a gauge for the community to distribute vault rewards.

QiDao is currently rewarding users on Polygon to borrow MAI against their assets. These rewards are separated by collateral type. Each collateral type receives ~14,400 Qi per week (0.05 Qi per block). The total amount of Qi being allocated to borrowing rewards is 187,200 Qi per week (0.65 Qi per block).

If the gauge is approved, the distribution of the 187,200 Qi per week would be decided by Qi holders every two weeks. Qi holders would have the option of allocating a percentage of the rewards to various collateral types. The aggregate distribution from all user responses would be used to award Qi to each collateral type.
