### Summary:

This proposal is to add new collateral assets for borrowing/minting MAI through vaults. By adding more assets, we attract a wider range of users who seek to gain stable value from their tokens at 0% interest. Vaults allow the users to gain the benefit of a stablecoin without spending the underlying asset.

Adding a collateral type will also include their Aave market token, if they have one. For example, voting to add wBTC will also be a vote for camwBTC.

If approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking these tokens in vaults and borrowing on their value at 0% interest. Doing so will allow users to benefit from the value of their tokens without spending them.

The minimum collateral to debt ratio for these collateral types will be 130% if accepted.

Your voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to app.mai.finance/boost. Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.

### Token information:

dQUICK
* Holders on Polygon: 15,442
* Fully diluted market cap: $84M

GHST
* Holders on Polygon: 14,988
* Fully diluted market cap: $57M

BAL
* Holders on Polygon: 9,579
* Fully diluted market cap: $48M

DPI
* Holders on Polygon: 322
* Fully diluted market cap: Unavailable

UNI
* Holders on Polygon: 6,785
* Fully diluted market cap: $11M

### Other Considerations:

* dQUICK: QuickSwap recently doubled their LP incentives for MAI and QI. dQUICK also grows in value over time by collecting QuickSwap rewards.

* GHST: Aavegotchi will likely be incentivizing borrowing against GHST with Frens tokens. They will also introduce Lao Zi wearables for Aavegotchis

* BAL: Balancer is currently incentivizing pools with QI and MAI with 5,000 BAL per week

* DPI: Index Coop is likely to incentivize borrowing against DPI

### Motivation:

* Increase user options
* Attract new audience
* Reduce protocol risk
* Increase protocol revenue
* Increase TVL

### Quorum Standards:

This will be an approval vote, meaning that users will be able to vote for any number of options. Options with more than 50% of the vote will be added as collateral, with a maximum of 3 options to be chosen. 

### Options:

* dQUICK
* GHST
* BAL
* DPI
* UNI
* Do not add new collaterals
