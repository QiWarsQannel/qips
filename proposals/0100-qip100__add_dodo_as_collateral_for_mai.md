Adding DODO as collateral for MAI will allow DODO holders to mint stablecoins at 0% interest against their tokens. Approving DODO will also approve its derivatives on whitelisted platforms (i.e. Beefy, Yearn, etc.).

DODO vaults will be eligible for borrow incentives.

In exchange for listing DODO as an accepted collateral, the DODO team will provide liquidity mining incentives for MAI on DODO (BNB Chain).

### Motivation

Partnering with another crosschain protocol will lead to new opportunities elsewhere
Increase TVL
Introduce MAI to new audiences

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

A weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:

* The options to add DODO collectively outweigh the option to not add DODO.
* The option to not add DODO receives more votes than any option to add DODO.

### Options

Add DODO as collateral at 135% min CDR
Add DODO as collateral at 140% min CDR
Add DODO as collateral at 145% min CDR
Add DODO as collateral at 150% min CDR
Further discussions needed

*min CDR  = minimum collateral to debt ratio
