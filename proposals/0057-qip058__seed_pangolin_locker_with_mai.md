This proposal is to decide on whether to seed MAI from the DAO into a Market.xyz lending market for Pangolin assets such as PNG, staked PNG, and LPs on Pangolin. Seeding this market would create stronger ties with one of the largest DEXs on Avalanche and with Market.xyz.

QiDao will strive to maintain competitive borrowing rates for MAI by managing the supply of MAI in this market.

### Strengthening Partnerships

In response to this marketâ€™s launch, Pangolin will start farms with MAI. This will help QiDao seed more MAI into this market, and grow the Pangolin Locker.

### Motivation

* Increase demand for MAI
* Strengthen relationship with Pangolin
* Introduce new audiences to MAI
* Gain more traction as a stablecoin

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Seed the market
* Further discussions needed

Note: the market has not yet been launched.
