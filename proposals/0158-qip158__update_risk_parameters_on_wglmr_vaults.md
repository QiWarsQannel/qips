### Proposal

Decrease minimum collateral to debt ratio (min. CDR) and reduce interest on Moonbeam WGLMR Vaults to make them competitive and reflect current risk levels

### MAI Adoption on Moonbeam

Despite being in place for several months, MAI borrowing has yet to gain much traction on Moonbeam. TVL on the WGLMR vault is at $16k. The issue is two-fold: users don't feel they can out earn the 8% interest rate, and the CDR of 250% is not competitive with what other platforms offer.

### Proposed Changes

1 - decrease the min. CDR to 150%. This is a conservative min. CDR, based on the risk matrixes for comparable chains Metis (155) and Moonriver (130) which both also score "B-"
2 - Replace the 8% interest rate with a 1% interest rate, to reflect the reduced risk since launch and keep the rate competitive
