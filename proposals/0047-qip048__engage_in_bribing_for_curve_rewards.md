This proposal is to engage in bribing for Curve rewards on Polygon and Fantom.

### Motivation

*Curve pools are liquidity pools specifically designed for equally-valued tokens. As a result, they aid in stabilizing stablecoin pegs.
* MAI needs more liquidity on these chains in order to accommodate growing demand for lending on QiDao
* Every $1 of bribing results in more than $1 worth of rewards, so this would be much more efficient than incentivizing liquidity directly with Qi.
* The Polygon team was expressed that they would bribe Curve voters as well with us if this proposal is approved.

### Proposal

* Seed MAI-am3Crv Curve pool with $1M from treasury (half on Polygon and half on Fantom).
* Stock up treasury to at least 2500 CRV
* Reach out to Curve community (Forum + Discord)
* Lock CRV for 4 years, create DAO proposal for Curve gauge
* Bribe voters with airdrops on Polygon
* Bribe with airdrops of 100k Qi per week for an LP on Fantom and 100k Qi per week for an LP on Polygon

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Approve proposal
* Further discussion needed
