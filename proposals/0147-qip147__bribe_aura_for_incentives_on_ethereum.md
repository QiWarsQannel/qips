Aura is a platform built to manage incentive allocations on Balancer. Protocols that bribe AURA holders for BAL incentives currently earn a 3x ROI. That means that for evert $1 of bribes, protocols receive $3 of rewards for their LP.

Proposed bribe: 15k QI / week
Proposed LP: MAI-USDC. This LP will then be migrated to MAI-Boosted USD pool when the new boosted pool is created on Balancer.

The protocol will farm this pool to build an AURA/BAL position.

### Motivation

The protocol needs to establish liquidity on Ethereum. While there are plans to part with protocols to receive votes on Curve, QiDao should maintain a base of liquidity to ensure MAIâ€™s usage.

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Accept proposal
* Further discussions needed
