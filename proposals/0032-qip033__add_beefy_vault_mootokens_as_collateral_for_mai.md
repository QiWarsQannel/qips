This proposal is to add Beefy vault tokens (mooTokens) as collateral for borrowing MAI.

Beefy vault tokens are received when users deposit tokens into Beefy strategies. For example, depositing DAI on Beefy gives users mooDAI as a receipt of deposit.

Tokens added would have to have underlying tokens that are already accepted as collateral. For example, if JOE is already accepted as collateral, then the protocol could add mooJOE as collateral.

Adding mooTokens as collateral would allow users to borrow against their mooTokens at 0% interest, while still earning yield from Beefy strategies.
