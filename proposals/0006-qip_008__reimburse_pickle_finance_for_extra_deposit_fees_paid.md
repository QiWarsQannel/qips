# Summary:

This proposal is to reimburse Pickle Finance for deposit fees they incurred twice in their recent launch of MAI jar.

Pickle recently released a jar for MAI liquidity mining. Shortly after launching, they noticed there was a small issue with their jars. As a result, they had to migrate all LPs to a new jar and redeposit their MAI liquidity into our rewards page. This caused them to have to pay our deposit fee twice. 

Pickle Finance covered the extra deposit fee through their treasury. To make it up to the community, Pickle will be rewarding users with 2x Pickle rewards for using their MAI jar next week. You can read more about it on their twitter thread

Given that all the funds from the jar were redeposited into QiDao rewards, we feel it appropriate to reimburse Pickle Finance for the extra deposit fees that their treasury covered (totalling 0.0195989 MAI-USDC LP tokens).

# Motivation:

Not charge Pickle Finance double deposit fees
Promote good faith between projects on Polygon

For: Reimburse Pickle for the extra deposit fees paid
