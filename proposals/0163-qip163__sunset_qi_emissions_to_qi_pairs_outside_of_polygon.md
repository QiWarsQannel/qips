End QI emissions and protocol-owned liquidity for QI liquidity pools outside of Polygon, leaving QI-MATIC as the sole liquidity pool for QI.

### Motivation

The costs of QI liquidity outside of Polygon outweigh their benefit. As seen from MAI's performance on Optimism, users are willing to bridge QI back to Polygon. This is evidenced by the parity in APR between chains that have QI liquidity, and chains that do not. 

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.
