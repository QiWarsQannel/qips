### Summary:

This proposal is to partner with mStable to incentivize MAI as a member of their stablecoin basket (as part of their feeder pool). Adding MAI to their feeder pool will bolster MAI’s peg, as it would provide for a stable exchange rate for MAI at a tighter spread than the USDC Swap.

### What is mStable?

mStable created a stablecoin index (mUSD) backed by a pool of stablecoins. Within this model, mStable has created feeder pools to encourage liquidity between stablecoins not in the index and mUSD.

### Proposed incentives would be the following:

mStable: 13,800 MTA per week
QiDao: 5,250 Qi per week

### Motivation:

* Bolster MAI’s peg
* Increase MAI’s visibility through marketing collaborations with mStable
* Add yield opportunities for MAI holders

___

For: Partner with mStable to provide incentives on MAI feeder pool

Against: Do not partner with mStable to provide incentives on MAI feeder pool
