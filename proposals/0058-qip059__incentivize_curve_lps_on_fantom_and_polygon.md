This proposal is to add two farms for MAI liquidity: one on Polygon and one on Fantom. There is currently overwhelming demand to borrow MAI. This represents an important opportunity for our protocol to expand. Having more MAI liquidity in liquidity pools is necessary to increase debt ceilings without negatively impacting MAI's peg.

Polygon Curve pool: MAI-USDC-USDT
Fantom Curve pool: MAI-a3CRV

Each pool would receive 50k Qi per week. Once Curve gauges are live outside of Ethereum, these rewards will be replaced by the 100k Qi bribing program previously approved by the DAO. 

### Motivation

* increase liquidity locked to allow for lending expansion
* increase TVL
* increase revenue from repayment fees and market operations

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be approved.

### Options

* Approve pools
* Further discussions needed
