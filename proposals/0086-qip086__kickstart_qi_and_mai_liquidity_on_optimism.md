In order to kickstart our growth on this chain, it is necessary to have some liquidity for MAI.

### Proposal

Allocate 3,000 QI / week to MAI+3pool on Optimism Curve factory. These rewards will transition to bribes for Curve voters when a gauge for MAI is available on Optimism.

Deploy $100,000-worth of capital on Uniswap V3 Optimism to set up protocol-owned liquidity for QI.

### Reasoning

Curve holds under $1M in liquidity on Optimism. 3k Qi / week in incentives should result in a MAI pool around $1M in liquidity, making it the largest pool for Curve on that chain.

The DAO should not allocate emissions for Qi liquidity on Optimism given how low the necessary amount is. With yearly emissions of Qi for the MAI pool at 156,000 QI, a pool of $100,000 should be sufficient for Qi trades.

Note: WETH and WBTC vaults are ready on Optimism.

### Motivation

* Kickstart growth for MAI vaults on Optimism
* Expose MAI to new audiences
* Grow revenue
* Grow TVL

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Accept proposal
* Further discussions needed
