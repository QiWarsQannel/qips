Currently, MATIC has the highest minimum collateral to debt ratio of any MAI vault. This does not reflect MATIC's risk profile. Lowering the current CDR would align MATIC with other MAI vaults.

### Motivation

* increase capital efficiency
* align min CDR with other vaults
* attract more TVL

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* 120% min CDR
* 125% min CDR
* 130% min CDR
* Further discussions needed
