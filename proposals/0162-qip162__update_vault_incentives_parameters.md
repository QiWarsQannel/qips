### Proposal:

* Lower the maximum amount of incentives that one collateral can receive from 20% to 15% of the total.
* Lower the minimum percentage of votes that a chain needs to "meet quorum" and receive incentives from 8.33% to 5%.
* Set a 100 MAI borrowing minimum to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault is higher - such as the 10k minimum on Ethereum vaults - which would supersede the 100 min.
* Reduce the total incentives from 180K to 150K QI a week. 

### Motivation:

* Ensure that borrow incentives are able to be directed to many chains, even smaller ones.
* Ensure that borrow incentives do not go solely to vaults with limited debt ceilings and that they accomplish the goal of encouraging more borrowing.
* Reduce gas costs, dust airdrops and ensure a minimum profitability of the incentives due to the 0.5% repayment fee by setting a minimum borrow.

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options:
