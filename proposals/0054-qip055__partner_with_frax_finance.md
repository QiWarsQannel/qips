Proposal from Frax Finance:

This proposal is to add FXS as collateral for MAI, add MAI as collateral for FRAX and create a FRAX-MAI LP.

### Partnership details:

* Add FXS as collateral for MAI. This includes FXS on all chains and derivatives of FXS.
* Frax Finance will mint 2M MAI using FXS to then seed a FRAX-MAI LP of $4M.
* Secure incentives from the DEX where we deposit the LP on to maximize volume and TVL
* Add MAI as collateral for minting/redeeming FRAX natively on Polygon

### Motivation:

* Both stablecoins will benefit from an added LP
* FXS as collateral will attract a new audience to QiDao
* Increased TVL from a new collateral

### Background on Frax Finance:

Frax is an algorithmic stablecoin protocol, behind FRAX. The protocol has a TVL of $1.22bn and can be bridged to 8 chains on Multichain (aka AnySwap).
