### Context

The current vault incentives system has stopped being profitable for the DAO. Most rewards are being given to vaults that don't contribute to the growth of our TVL nor the growth of revenue.

The DAO should balance the benefit of having QI bribes and importance of vault incentives in growing QiDao's TVL.

### Proposal

Limit the incentives each vault type can get to 20%. Any extra percentage over 20% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.
