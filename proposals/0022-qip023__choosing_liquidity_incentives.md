**Please read the entire proposal before voting, as there are several factors to consider.**

### Summary:

Our current liquidity mining incentives on QuickSwap are scheduled to end on September 2nd. This proposal is for the community to decide on the incentives amount for liquidity mining on QuickSwap.

The liquidity mining pairs QiDao currently incentivizes on QuickSwap started on May 5th and were scheduled to last 120 days. Below is an overview of the current rewards:

Qi rewards:
* MAI-USDC LP receives 1 Qi per block
* QI-MAI LP receives 2 Qi per block

These LPs currently have $110 million in TVL and $2.7 million of 24 hr trading volume.

Below is a summary of LP rewards to be given out by QuickSwap.

* Stablecoin pools: 20 QUICK per day. QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.
* QI pools: 10 QUICK per day. QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.
* Some QUICK rewards (TBD) will be given to MAI-QUICK LP

### Other considerations

QuickSwap's rewards are a commitment that assume QiDao will reduce its incentives by half (50%). Lowering incentives beyond that point could alter the amount of QuickSwapâ€™s incentives.

### Quorum standards

The winning vote must receive more than 60% of the vote. If no option receives at least 60% of the vote, then there will be a second round vote with the top 2 choices from this vote.

### Options

* Reduce incentives by 25%
* Reduce incentives by 50%
* Reduce incentives by 75%
* Do not reduce incentives
