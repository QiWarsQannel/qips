# Summary:

This proposal is to add a voting boost opportunity for users that stake Qi. eQi (escrowed Qi) will allow us to give boosted benefits to long-term Qi stakers. The size of the boost will depend on the length of the lockup period: the longer the lockup, the greater the boost (example 4 years lock up will get a 4x boost). Qi Powah boosting will become the first pillar of Qi staking, and will lead the way for protocol revenue sharing and more.

QiPowah is the voting power of a user within the voting system. It accounts for the Qi users own, including Qi in liquidity pools, vesting Qi, and staked Qi.

In the future, users will receive fees earned from the protocol through this mechanism. Implementation is TBD.

# Motivation:

* Encourage long-term Qi holding  
* Rewarding long term Qi stakers through boosted incentives
* Initiate first step to Qi staking
