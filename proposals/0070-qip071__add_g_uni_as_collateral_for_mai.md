We've received the following proposal from Gelato to add G-UNI as collateral for MAI.

### What is G-UNI?

G-UNI pool tokens are fungible, fee compounding ERC20 wrappers which represent Uniswap v3 LP positions. They enable Uniswap Liquidity Providers to use their deposited liquidity positions as collateral in lending. This allows for leveraring LP positions, increasing liquidity in pools.

This vote is to whitelist G-UNI in general. Individual LPs will be added based on what underlying assets are already accepted.

Security: G-UNI has been audited multiple times and is also used as collateral in MakerDAO and Aave on Ethereum.

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be added.

### Options

* Add G-UNI at 130% min CDR
* Add G-UNI at 135% min CDR
* Add G-UNI at 140% min CDR
* Further discussions needed

min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio
