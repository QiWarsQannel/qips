This proposal is to approve an amount of Qi to run Qi Bonds for 1 month.

Qi Bonds allow QiDao to buy LP tokens from users with Qi. This model has been used by several other projects in DeFi as an alternative to providing liquidity mining incentives. 

The benefit is that the protocol keeps the LP tokens it pays Qi for. With traditional liquidity mining, the protocol pays users to provide liquidity and does not gain any assets in return.

This proof of concept will allow us to run our implementation in the open market. If the bonds achieve the desired outcome, the community may vote to expand this program.

### Bond details

* Proposed Qi allocation: 400,000 Qi to be used over 1 month
* LP pairs: Qi with a stablecoin
* Bond parameters to be managed by core team

### Quorum Standard

The option with the most votes will be adopted.
