This proposal is to lower the minimum collateral to debt ratio (CDR) for Stake DAO's USD strategy to 110%. This would bring it in line with Yearn vault DAI.

The risk profile for Stake DAO's USD strategy is similar to that of Yearn vault DAI. The underlying tokens are stablecoins, so the likelihood of significant price volatility is fairly low.

### Motivation

* Increase attractiveness of our vaults to new users
* Strengthen relations with Stake DAO
* Increase TVL

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Lower min CDR to 110%
* Further discussions needed
