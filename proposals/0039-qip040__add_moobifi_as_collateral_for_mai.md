We've received a proposal from Beefy Finance to add mooBIFI as collateral for borrowing MAI. 

mooBIFI is the staked, yield-bearing form of BIFI. By using it as collateral, you’re able to collect BIFI staking rewards while borrowing against its value.

By adding more assets, we attract a wider range of users who seek to gain stable value from their tokens at 0% interest. Vaults allow the users to gain the benefit of a stablecoin without spending the underlying asset.

If approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking mooBIFI in vaults and borrowing on its value at 0% interest. mooBIFI derivatives will also be approved as collateral for MAI.

mooBIFI will be added on networks where it has a Chainlink oracle. 

Your voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to app.mai.finance/boost. Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.

### Partnership details

Beefy is one of the largest yield aggregators, with over $1B in deposits. As part of this partnership, Beefy will incentivize MAI’s vault on Beefy Fantom with $100,000 in mooBIFI for one month from the time of launch.

### Motivation:
* Increase user options
* Attract new audience
* Strengthen relationship with Beefy
* Reduce protocol risk
* Increase protocol revenue
* Increase TVL

### Quorum Standards:

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options:

* Add mooBIFI at 130% min CDR
* Add mooBIFI at 135% min CDR
* Add mooBIFI at 140% min CDR
* Further discussion is needed
