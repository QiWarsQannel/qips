**Please read the entire proposal before voting, as there are several factors to consider.**

### Summary:

Our current liquidity mining incentives on QuickSwap are scheduled to end on September 2nd. This proposal is for the community to decide what Stablecoin pair or pairs to reward. The amount of rewards will be decided in another proposal.

The liquidity mining pairs QiDao currently incentivizes on QuickSwap started on May 5th and were scheduled to last 120 days. Below is an overview of the current rewards:

Qi rewards:
* MAI-USDC LP receives 1 Qi per block
* QI-MAI LP receives 2 Qi per block

Below are some highlights from the offers given to QiDao by some of the top 5 AMMs on Polygon for our stablecoin pair(s).

### QuickSwap: 

Rewards committed for stablecoin pool(s): 20 QUICK per day ($12.5k value per day). QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.

Can transactions route through MAI? Yes

### DFYN

Rewards committed for stablecoin pool(s): 24,750 Dfyn per day ($30k value per day)

Can transactions route through MAI? Yes

### SushiSwap

Estimated rewards for stablecoin pool(s): 432 SUSHI per day ($5.4k value per day)

Can transactions route through MAI? No

### Other considerations

Now that MAI will be added as a routing token, having more LPs with MAI can increase MAI's trading volume and strengthen its price stability.

### Quorum standards

The winning vote must get at least 60% of the vote. If no option receives at least 60% of the vote, then there will be a second round vote with the top 2 choices.

### Options: 
* Option 1: 3 Stable pairs (MAI-USDC, MAI-DAI, MAI-USDT)
* Option 2: 2 Stable pairs (MAI-USDC, MAI-DAI)
* Option 3: 2 Stable pairs (MAI-USDC, MAI-USDT)
* Option 4: 1 Stable pair (MAI-USDC)
* Option 5: No incentives for stablecoin pairs
