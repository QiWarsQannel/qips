This proposal is to decide on whether to extend QuickSwap liquidity mining rewards for QI and MAI liquidity.

The team is currently allocating considerable time to new developments, including Qi bonding, new vaults, and new chain deployments. The team is also working on key partnerships for integrations with our lending vaults. These two initiatives will have a material impact on deciding what we do with incentives going forward. 

As a result, we propose that the DAO extend the current rewards we have on QuickSwap until Lohri (Jan. 13, 2022). By then, we'll have enough development capacity to implement any changes from the community. The opportunity cost of pausing what we're building / working on right now is too great.
