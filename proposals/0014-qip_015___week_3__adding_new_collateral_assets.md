### Summary:

What collateral type do you want to see added to QiDao?

This proposal is to add new collateral assets to borrow MAI against. The top  ranked choice from this community vote will be added as collateral.

Adding a collateral type will also include their Aave market token if they have one. Example voting to add wBTC will also be a vote for camwBTC.

If approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking these tokens in vaults and borrowing on their value at 0% interest. Doing so will allow users to benefit from the value of their tokens without spending them.

The minimum collateral to debt ratio for these collateral types will be 150% if accepted.

Your voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to [app.mai.finance/boost](app.mai.finance/boost). Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.

### Motivation
* Increase TVL
* Increase user options
* Attract new audience
* Reduce protocol risk
