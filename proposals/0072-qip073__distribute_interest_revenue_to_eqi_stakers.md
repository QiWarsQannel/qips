Distribute 50% of interest revenue from market operations to eQi stakers. If passed, the DAO would buy Qi with this interest revenue and distribute it to eQi stakers weekly.

The DAO makes over $200k/week from interest revenue. This revenue comes from seeding lending markets with MAI. All interest revenue is denominated in MAI and stored in the treasury's addresses.
