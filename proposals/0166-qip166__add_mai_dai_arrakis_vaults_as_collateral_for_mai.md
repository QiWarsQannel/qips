MAI liquidity has been a recurring blocker for increasing debt ceilings and growing QiDaoâ€™s TVL. Given the 0% interest model of MAI loans, it is difficult to grow liquidity for MAI under conventional liquidity mining methods.

MakerDAO previously added DAI-USDC LPs as collateral for DAI via Arrakis Uni V3 positions. This has created over $1bn in liquidity for DAI LPs that are not incentivized. That amounts to sizable savings in liquidity mining for DAI liquidity. Link to MakerDAO vaults: https://oasis.app/asset/dai#earn.

This proposal seeks to follow a similar path as MakerDAO, but on Polygon.
