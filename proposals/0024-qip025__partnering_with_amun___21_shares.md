### Summary:

Amun / 21 Shares has approached QiDao to include QI in their Polygon index token. We’re forwarding this proposal to the community to vote on whether to approve this partnership.

As part of the deal, QiDao would provide $1.4 million in Qi to seed the index. QiDao would then receive an equal amount in the index token, which would be backed by funds from the other projects involved. 

The Amun team has already partnered with Polygon, who will make up 50% of the index with MATIC. The other projects that will be included are QuickSwap, Aavegotchi, Adamant, and DFYN. QiDao’s allocation is currently 6.8% of the index, ahead of ADDY and DFYN (and behind QUICK, GHST, and MATIC).

### Motivation

The token will be available on both Polygon and Ethereum, allowing Ethereum-native investors to access QI without bridging funds to Polygon. 

Amun will commit to marketing the token through giveaways, listings, and social media content.
