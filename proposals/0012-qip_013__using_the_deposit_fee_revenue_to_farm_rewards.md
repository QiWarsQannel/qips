## Summary:
**How can we use the idle LP Tokens earned as protocol revenue to better incentivize Qi stakers, reduce Qi emissions, and improve the health of the protocol.**

As of week 11 the protocol has earned around $1,836,864 value in QuickSwap LP tokens (MAI-QI and MAI-USDC) through the farm deposit fees (0.5%). These LP tokens are owned by Qi holders and are currently sitting in the treasury.

### What could we do with the holdings?

We have the opportunity to utilize those LP tokens to farm Qi in the [mai.finance)[https://mai.finance) pools and redistribute those rewards back to Qi stakers. Deposit fee revenue is averaging just under $175,000 per week. As we earn more deposit fees we would continue to redeposit those into the pools to maximize returns.

### Current farm statistics

Our current farming rewards are scheduled to end on November 1st. During the time between now and then we could use 100% of the Deposit fee revenue to farm Qi. The Qi received through farming rewards would be distributed to Qi stakers (100%) and the rest held by the treasury for future use. After Nov. 1st the community can decide what will happen with the deposit fee LP tokens.

### Possible returns (all estimates based on current values): 
_Using tokens as is:_
MAI-QI rewards: 12,806.16 Qi/week
MAI-USDC rewards: 7,101.63 Qi/week
*Total rewards: 19,907.79 Qi/week*

_All in MAI-QI:_
Total rewards: 79,394.10 Qi/week
*This would entail selling around 800,000 USDC from the MAI-USDC LPs received and buying Qi*

_All in MAI-USDC:_
Total Rewards: 8,043 Qi/week
*This would entail selling around 130,000 QI from the MAI-QI LPs received and buying USDC*

### Voting Options:

* Option 1: Farm using LP token revenue (As Received)
* Option 2: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-Qi)
* Option 3: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-USDC)
* Option 4: Do not Farm using LP token revenue (Reject)
