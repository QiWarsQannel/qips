This proposal is to add camDAI (compounding Aave market DAI) as collateral for borrowing MAI through vaults.

By adding more assets, we attract a wider range of users who seek to gain stable value from their tokens at 0% interest. Vaults allow the users to gain the benefit of a stablecoin without spending the underlying asset.

If approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking camDAI in vaults and borrowing on its value at 0% interest. Doing so will allow users to compound rewards from amDAI, while being able to use its value.

Your voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to app.mai.finance/boost. Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.

### Motivation:

* Increase user options
* Attract new audience
* Reduce protocol risk
* Increase protocol revenue
* Increase TVL

### Quorum Standards:

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options:

* Add camDAI at 115% min CDR
* Add camDAI at 110% min CDR
* Add camDAI at 105% min CDR
* Add camDAI at 101% min CDR
* Do not add camDAI

CDR = Collateral to Debt Ratio
