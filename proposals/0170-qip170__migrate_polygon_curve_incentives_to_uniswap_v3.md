Migrate Qi emissions from the MAI+3CRV pool on Curve Polygon to a MAI-USDC managed pool on Uniswap V3 Polygon.

The position would be managed by Arrakis and can be found here: https://beta.arrakis.finance/vaults/137/0xa199569af06cb68960869fe376c9b41f68d8e2d1

### Motivation

MAI needs to increase its volume to obtain Chainlink oracles on new chains like Ethereum, Metis, and Optimism. Having oracles on other chains will open the door for new use cases for MAI, such as more Aave listings and perpetuals collateral.

Currently, MAIâ€™s pool on Curve Polygon produces under $40,000 of volume per day. This pool is incentivized with 50,000 QI per week. In contrast, the MAI-USDC pool on Uniswap V3 is not incentivized and produces $700,000 of volume per day.

One reason for this is the low fees on the Uniswap pool, of 0.01%. These fees are 3x lower than those on Curve.
