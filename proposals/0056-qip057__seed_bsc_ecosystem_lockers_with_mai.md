This proposal is to decide on whether to seed MAI from the DAO into a Market.xyz lending market for BSC ecosystem assets such as BNB, CAKE, BSW, and other native assets.

Seeding these markets would deepen our relationship with some of the top projects in BSC and with Market.xyz. This will introduce MAI to new communities and become a better known stable in the ecosystem.

### Strengthening partnerships:

The team will secure deals with protocols on BSC in exchange for their assets being listed on these markets.

Market.xyz - Extending our crosschain partnership.

QiDao will strive to maintain competitive borrowing rates for MAI by managing the supply of MAI in this market.

### Motivation

* Increase demand for MAI
* Introduce new audiences to MAI
* Gain more traction as a stablecoin on BSC

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Seed the market
* Further discussions needed
note: the market has not yet been launched.
