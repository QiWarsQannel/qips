**Please read the entire proposal before voting, as there are several factors to consider.**

### Summary:

Our current liquidity mining incentives on QuickSwap are scheduled to end on September 2nd. This proposal is for the community to decide what Qi pair or pairs to reward. The amount of rewards will be decided in another proposal.

The liquidity mining pairs QiDao currently incentivizes on QuickSwap started on May 5th and were scheduled to last 120 days. Below is an overview of the current rewards:

Qi rewards:
* MAI-USDC LP receives 1 Qi per block
* QI-MAI LP receives 2 Qi per block

Below are some highlights from the offers given to QiDao by some of the top 5 AMMs on Polygon for our stablecoin pair(s).

### DFYN

Rewards committed: QI pool: 8,250 Dfyn per day ($10k value per day)

### QuickSwap: 

Rewards: Qi pool: 10 QUICK per day ($6.25k value per day). QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.

### SushiSwap

Estimated rewards: QI pool: 173 SUSHI per day ($2.2k value per day)

### Considerations

Pairing QI with a stablecoin induces higher impermanent loss than pairing QI with a non-stablecoin. This causes the net gain for liquidity providers to be less, which can reduce the size of the pool.

### Quorum standards

The winning vote must get at least 60% of the vote. If no option receives at least 60% of the vote, then there will be a second round vote with the top 2 choices.

### Options: 
* Option 1: 2 QI pools (QI-ETH and QI-MATIC)
* Option 2: QI-MAI
* Option 3: QI-ETH
* Option 4: QI-MATIC
* Option 5: No incentives for QI pairs
