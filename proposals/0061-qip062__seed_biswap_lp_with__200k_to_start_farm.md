BiSwap will start a farm for MAI-BUSD on BSC on February 3. This is in parallel to QiDao launching a market for their assets.

In order for the farm to be started, the DAO needs to seed $200k in liquidity. We proposal to use DAO funds to seed the minimum amount.

### Motivation
* Kickstart our MAI pool on BSC to expand MAI lending
* Increase revenue by building borrow demand for MAI
* Grow TVL on BSC

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options
