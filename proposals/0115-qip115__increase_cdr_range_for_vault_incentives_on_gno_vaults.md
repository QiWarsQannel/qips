Increase the range for vault incentives on GNO vaults from 155%-400% to 155%-500% collateral to debt ratio.

Currently, the Gnosis Chain team uses GNO vaults to borrow MAI. The resulting MAI has then been used to provide liquidity on Curve.

In response to market volatility, the Gnosis Chain team would like to widen the vault incentives range on GNO vaults to manage their position more conservatively while still receiving rewards.

### Motivation

* Gnosis Chain is currently allocating GNO rewards for MAI liquidity on Curve
* QI earn by the Gnosis Chain treasury would be used entirely towards incentivizing QI-GNO liquidity
* Adjusting these parameters would strengthen QiDaoâ€™s relationship with Gnosis Chain

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options

* Accept proposal
* Reject proposal
