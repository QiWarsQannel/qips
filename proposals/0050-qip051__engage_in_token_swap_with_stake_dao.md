This proposal is to swap $500,000 worth of governance tokens with Stake DAO.

A token swap between both projects would create aligned incentives, promoting the sharing of resources and collaboration between both projects.

Both projects have agreed to lock the tokens swapped for 4 years.

### Synergies

* Stake DAO strategies get access to leverage at QiDao. As Stake DAO and QiDao deploy on other chains, future Stake DAO strategies will also have access to leverage at QiDao

* QiDao does not charge interest for stablecoin loans, increasing yield opportunities for sdTokens

* Stake DAO holds CRV, which can be used to vote for Curve incentives for MAI. This in turn allows for high debt ceilings for sdToken MAI vaults

* Both projects have deployed on multiple chains

* QiDao’s partnership with Market.xyz would allow Stake DAO assets without chainlink oracles access to low-interest stablecoin loans

### Stake DAO

Stake DAO’s mission is to build open products which make the most sophisticated DeFi strategies easily accessible to anyone. It offers a wide range of products such as DeFi strategy vaults, a DEX aggregator, an NFT marketplace, PoS staking, LP Farming, and a crypto academy.
