The Protocol has made on average 5,000 Matic daily on repayment fees. We are looking at ways to use these revenues to encourage the long-term utility of holding Qi. In the options below, we contemplate using this Matic revenue to buy Qi from the open market, thereby increasing the daily buy pressure for Qi.

Below are the two options we want to vote on for what to do with Qi from buybacks.

# Buyback to Distribute

Distribute Qi from the buyback to users that stake Qi. This would keep the Qi in circulation as it would be distributed to Qi stakers post-buyback.

# Buyback to Treasury

Store Qi from the buyback in the treasury in a separate account. Storing Qi removes it from circulation. This Qi could be burned at a later time if the community votes to do so. If burning is enabled later, it would make Qi a deflationary currency.
