CAKE is the governance token for PancakeSwap, the largest protocol on BNB Chain. The project holds a TVL of around $5bn. CAKEâ€™s current market cap is $2.3Bn.

Adding CAKE would also add its derivatives.

### Motivation

* Increase TVL
* Increase revenue
* Attract new users

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

A weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:

* The options to add CAKE collectively outweigh the option to not add CAKE.
* The option to not add CAKE receives more votes than any option to add CAKE.

### Options

* Add CAKE at 130% min CDR
* Add CAKE at 135% min CDR
* Add CAKE at 140% min CDR
* Further discussions needed

*min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio
