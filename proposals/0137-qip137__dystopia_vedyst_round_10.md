This proposal is to allocate QiDaoâ€™s voting power on Dystopia to pools with MAI and/or QI.

500k votes will be used to vote for FRAX-MAI, given our partnership agreement with Frax Finance. The rest of the voting power (roughly 50%) will be distributed based on this vote. 

A pool can be excluded from the initial vote draft if the volume is very low, if there is any malicious intent, or if incentivizing such LP is not aligned with the vision of the DAO, risk parameters and previously approved QIPs.

Voting will be rounded to the nearest 1% given a minimum required vote allocation of 1%. If an option does not have enough votes for a 1% allocation, its allocation will be evenly distributed among other options. The Gauge results will last for 2 weeks.
