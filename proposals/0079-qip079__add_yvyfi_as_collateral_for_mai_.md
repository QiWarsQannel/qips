Add Yearn vault YFI as collateral for MAI.

yvYFI is an interest-bearing form of YFI (the governance token for Yearn Finance). There is $17.5M locked in yvYFI on Fantom. Liquidity for YFI on Fantom stands at around $14M, mostly on Solidly.

### Motivation

* Increase TVL
* Increase revenue
* Attract new users

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

A weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:

* The options to add yvYFI collectively outweigh the option to not add yvYFI.
* The option to not add yvYFI tokens receives more votes than any option to add yvYFI.

### Options
Add yvYFI at 130% min CDR
Add yvYFI at 135% min CDR
Add yvYFI at 140% min CDR
Further discussions needed

*min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio
