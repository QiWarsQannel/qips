This proposal is to decide on whether to incentivize MAI and QI liquidity on Avalanche with Qi tokens.

In order to continue growing on Avalanche while maintaining MAI’s peg, the protocol needs liquidity pools holding MAI. 

### Proposed LPs

* 20,000 QI / week for MAI-3CRV on Curve

* 10,000 QI / week for QI-AVAX on Trader Joe

A 0.5% deposit fee will be charged for staking these LPs, as is customary with other QiDao liquidity mining.

### Motivation
* Support a larger TVL and new collaterals on Avalanche
* Improve levering experience
* Support MAI’s peg on Avalanche
* Introduce new audiences to QiDao

### Quorum Standards
The option with the most vote will be adopted

### Options
* Incentivize new LPs
* Further discussion needed
