### Background

Exploit

The Superfluid vesting contract that held Qi allocations for the DAO was exploited. As a result, all of the Qi in that contract (19,387,874.05 Qi) was stolen and sold in the market.

Compensation from Superfluid

The affected wallets have not received any compensation from Superfluid. Any future compensation from Superfluid will go to the DAO

Initial Allocations

88% of Qi’s total supply was allocated to the community, with 12% allocated to early contributors and the core team. Our community allocation is significantly higher than those of other projects.

### Proposal

Restore the ~19M Qi taken from the protocol to reinstate allocation vesting. This will not affect the current emissions schedule for farms. All vesting would resume as detailed in the docs.

### Motivation

The team is married to QiDao. We spend all day, every day working for the protocol. We don't take days off or work for other projects. QiDao is our number one focus. This level of commitment exists because we’re committed to our vision for the project and because we had a stake in the protocol. For the team to continue this level of commitment, the team should continue to have a stake in the project.
