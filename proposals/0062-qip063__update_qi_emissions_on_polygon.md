The protocol will soon start incentivizing new MAI pools on Curve. This will result in an inflation increase for QI. This proposal is to counter that inflation increase with a reduction in QI liquidity emissions.

Having deep MAI liquidity is important in growing the size of debt ceiling increases. This boosts TVL and future revenue. QI liquidity, on the other hand, serves to provide low slippage trades for QI. Given our current market cap ($40M) and liquid market cap ($20M), the QI-MATIC LP is larger than necessary for providing low slippage trades.

Qi liquidity currently receives more incentives than MAI liquidity on Polygon. As the protocol continues to own more of QI's liquidity on the market, the DAO can continue to lower emissions for QI liquidity.

The protocol currently owns $3.6M of QI-MATIC and $340k of QI-DAI.

### Proposal details

* Lower QI-MATIC emissions by 25%
* End QI-BAL emissions (currently 15k QI / week)
* Move part of QI-BAL emissions to MAI liquidity on Balancer (increase from 15k QI / week to 20k QI / week)

### Quorum Standards
