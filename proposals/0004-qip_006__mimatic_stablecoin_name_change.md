## Summary:

This proposal is to change the name of $miMatic (QiDaoâ€™s stablecoin).

Several community members have proposed we shift the name of our stablecoin. Below are the names that have been mentioned the most:

MAI
qiUSD
miUSD
qiDolla
miDollar
miStable

The naming change will only happen on the frontend so that a contract migration is not required. If the name is changed, you will see the new name on all dapps that accept miMatic. It will be referred to as the name that it is changed to, but the smart contract will remain the same. Example: MAI (miMatic).

## Motivation:
Make it easier for people to identify our stablecoin
Reflect the multi-collateral nature of the stablecoin
Reduce confusion about whether the coin is a stablecoin
