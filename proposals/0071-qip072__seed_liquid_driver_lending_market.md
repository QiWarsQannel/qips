This proposal is to decide on whether to seed MAI from the DAO into a Market.xyz to borrow against Liquid Driver assets.

Seeding this market would deepen our relationship with both Liquid Driver and Market.xyz.

For more information about Liquid Driver check out their docs: https://docs.liquiddriver.finance/

### Motivation:
* Liquid Driver using their governance power to vote for MAI pools across Fantom DEXs
* Increase demand for MAI
* Introduce new audiences to MAI
* Increase revenue for the DAO 

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options
* Seed Liquid Driver markets
* Further discussions needed
