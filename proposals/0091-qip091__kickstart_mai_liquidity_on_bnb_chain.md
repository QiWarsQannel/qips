### Proposal

Allocate 3,000 QI / week to MAI+val3EPS (BUSD+USDC+BUSD-T) on Ellipsis.

Deploy $100,000-worth of capital on BNB Chain to set up protocol-owned liquidity for QI.

If bribing protocols on BNB Chain results in more rewards for this MAI LP, then QiDao will use the 3,000 QI / week to bribe for rewards.

### Reasoning

This liquidity will allow the protocol to begin lending on BNB Chain. It will not serve as the only liquidity sink for MAI, as other protocols will incentivize MAI LPs as we develop on the chain.

val3EPS earns rewards from both Ellipsis and Valas (an Aave fork on BNB Chain).

In order to limit emissions, it is best to deploy Qi liquidity as opposed to incentivizing a pair. The amount of QI liquidity necessary is low.

### Motivation

* Kickstart growth for MAI vaults on BNB Chain
* Expose MAI to new audiences
* Grow revenue
* Grow TVL

### Quorum Standards

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### Options
