### Summary:
What collateral type do you want to see added to QiDao?

This proposal is to add new collateral assets to borrow MAI against. The top 3 ranked choices from this community vote will be added as collateral on the day the voting ends.

Adding a collateral type will also include their Aave market token if they have one. Example voting to add wBTC will also be a vote for camwBTC.

If approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking these tokens in vaults and borrowing on their value at 0% interest. Doing so will allow users to benefit from the value of their tokens without spending them.

The minimum collateral to debt ratio for these collateral types will be 150% if accepted.

Your voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to [app.mai.finance/boost](https://app.mai.finance/boost). Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.

### Motivation
* Increase TVL
* Increase user options
* Attract new audience
* Reduce protocol risk
