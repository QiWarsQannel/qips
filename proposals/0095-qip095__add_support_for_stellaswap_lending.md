### Proposal

Add Support for StellaSwap Vaults.

### StellaSwap Vaults

StellaSwap and Manhattan Finance wish to create vault lending for MAI on Moonbeam. Vaults will allow users to mint MAI at a fixed interest rate against approved assets. This proposal seeks approval for xSTELLA.

### Partnership details

StellaSwap may add an origination and/or repayment fee on top of the fixed interest - if xSTELLA vaults are added to the StellaSwap UI. These fees will be retained entirely by StellaSwap.

In exchange for MAI support for xSTELLA, StellaSwap will introduce liquidity mining rewards for MAI LPs on their DEX. This will provide the necessary liquidity for StellaSwap vaults to succeed on Moonbeam.
