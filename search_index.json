Many in the community want to lower the downside of being liquidated. Right now, a risky vault is bought at ~149% collateral to debt ratio. This results in a loss of ~1/3 of the collateral value for the original vault owner (+ 100% of the debt is paid off and gained as an asset - 100% of the Matic is lost).\nIn order to minimize this loss, we propose lowering the liquidation ratio.\nIn addition to lowering the liquidation ratio, we could structure borrowing so that the minimum collateral to debt ratio at the time of borrowing is still 150% (on the front end), but the liquidation ratio is lower (125%). \nThis would both reduce the chances of being liquidated and manage the miMatic supply as it relates to locked collateral.\nAs the Protocol grows, we plan on implementing a stability pool to manage liquidation (subject to community discussion).\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nLower liquidation ratio to 125%\n27.97%\n\n\nMaintain 150% liquidation ratio\n72.03%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0002-qip_004__revenue_usage.html":{"url":"proposals/0002-qip_004__revenue_usage.html","title":"QIP 004: Revenue Usage","keywords":"","body":"QIP 004: Revenue Usage\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-05-24T17:00:00.000Z\n2021-05-28T17:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nThe Protocol has made on average 5,000 Matic daily on repayment fees. We are looking at ways to use these revenues to encourage the long-term utility of holding Qi. In the options below, we contemplate using this Matic revenue to buy Qi from the open market, thereby increasing the daily buy pressure for Qi.\nBelow are the two options we want to vote on for what to do with Qi from buybacks.\nBuyback to Distribute\nDistribute Qi from the buyback to users that stake Qi. This would keep the Qi in circulation as it would be distributed to Qi stakers post-buyback.\nBuyback to Treasury\nStore Qi from the buyback in the treasury in a separate account. Storing Qi removes it from circulation. This Qi could be burned at a later time if the community votes to do so.

These LP tokens are owned by Qi holders and are currently sitting in the treasury. \nTreasuries current QuickSwap LP token holdings:\n\nTreasury multisig: 0x3feacf904b152b1880bde8bf04ac9eb636fee4d8\nWhat could we do with the holdings?\nWe have the opportunity to utilize those LP tokens to farm Qi in the [mai.finance)[https://mai.finance) pools and redistribute those rewards back to Qi stakers. Deposit fee revenue is averaging just under $175,000 per week. As we earn more deposit fees we would continue to redeposit those into the pools to maximize returns.\nCurrent farm statistics\nOur current farming rewards are scheduled to end on November 1st. During the time between now and then we could use 100% of the Deposit fee revenue to farm Qi. The Qi received through farming rewards would be distributed to Qi stakers (100%) and the rest held by the treasury for future use. After Nov. 1st the community can decide what will happen with the deposit fee LP tokens. \n\nPossible returns (all estimates based on current values):\nUsing tokens as is:\nMAI-QI rewards: 12,806.16 Qi/week\nMAI-USDC rewards: 7,101.63 Qi/week\nTotal rewards: 19,907.79 Qi/week\nAll in MAI-QI:\nTotal rewards: 79,394.10 Qi/week\nThis would entail selling around 800,000 USDC from the MAI-USDC LPs received and buying Qi\nAll in MAI-USDC:\nTotal Rewards: 8,043 Qi/week\nThis would entail selling around 130,000 QI from the MAI-QI LPs received and buying USDC\nVoting Options:\n\nOption 1: Farm using LP token revenue (As Received)\nOption 2: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-Qi)\nOption 3: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-USDC)\nOption 4: Do not Farm using LP token revenue (Reject)\n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAs Received\n1.38%\n\n\nAll MAI-Qi\n95.36%\n\n\nAll MAI-USDC\n1.88%\n\n\nReject\n1.39%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0013-qip_014__incentivize_collateral_vaults_to_borrow_mai.html":{"url":"proposals/0013-qip_014__incentivize_collateral_vaults_to_borrow_mai.html","title":"QIP 014: Incentivize collateral vaults to borrow MAI","keywords":"","body":"QIP 014: Incentivize collateral vaults to borrow MAI\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-08-03T22:00:00.000Z\n2021-08-07T22:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nSummary:\nHow might we incentivize borrowing MAI through vaults and attract new users?\nCurrently around 90% of the MAI in circulation was minted through the USDC swap. We want to increase the amount of MAI in circulation minted through vaults. Having more collateral in our vaults will help grow our TVL as well as increase the protocol repayment fees (30% of which are distributed to Qi stakers).\nWe also want to attract new users to try our vaults and become part of the QiDao community. With attractive borrowing offers we should be able to increase the number of users, TVL, MAI in circulation, and protocol revenue. \nIncentive Proposal\n\nMinting MAI through collateral vaults would be incentivized for vaults whose collateral to debt ratio is between 25% and 270% above the liquidation ratio.\nThe rewards would last as long as they are net profitable to the protocol.\n\nHow it would work:\nUsers will be eligible for rewards for opening vaults and borrowing MAI through a boosted vault type. These rewards will come in the form of Qi. These incentives will transform QiDao vaults from being 0% loans to negative interest loans (getting paid to take loans) during the boost period. Users would get rewarded based on the amount of the MAI they borrow through a specific collateral type. For example, if a user minted 10% of the MAI attributed to WETH collateral, they would receive 10% of the Qi / block rewards for that vault type.\nAdditional info & Resources:\nCurrent collateral types accepted on QiDao are MATIC, wETH, AAVE, LINK, and CRV (as well as their amTokens if they have one). We will have weekly QIPs for our community to vote on collaterals they would like to see added.\nPartner projects could incentivize their community to lock up their tokens in QiDao vaults by adding additional rewards. Project boosts will be separate from the Qi rewards. The projects will determine the amount and length of their boost. Their boost would likely be paid in their token.\nQi emissions currently sit around 3.34/block. Assuming 1 to 2 debt ceiling increases per week, the protocol would accrue more repayment fee revenue than it would spend in Qi incentives at 0.05 Qi / block (at $1.07 Qi price) for each vault type.\nVault incentives would be claimed each week on Wednesday for the previous week. Users will be able to claim incentives by going to the rewards page and clicking claim on the vault incentives line item.\nMotivation\n\nPromote locking collateral to borrow MAI\nAttract new users\nIncrease QiDao TVL\nIntroduce negative interest rates (earning yield for borrowing) to vault owners\n\nOption 1: Incentivize minting MAI through vaults with 0.1 Qi/block\nOption 2: Incentivize minting MAI through vaults with 0.05 Qi/block\nOption 3: Do not incentivize borrowing MAI through vaults\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\n29.95%\n\n\nOption 2\n61.55%\n\n\nOption 3\n8.50%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0014-qip_015___week_3__adding_new_collateral_assets.html":{"url":"proposals/0014-qip_015___week_3__adding_new_collateral_assets.html","title":"QIP 015: (Week 3) Adding new collateral assets","keywords":"","body":"QIP 015: (Week 3) Adding new collateral assets\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-08-05T22:00:00.000Z\n2021-08-08T22:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nSummary:\nWhat collateral type do you want to see added to QiDao?\nThis proposal is to add new collateral assets to borrow MAI against.

Given that this is a community-run project, we’re forwarding this proposal for the community to vote on.\nSecurity and protocol safety is of utmost importance to us and our users. Before releasing any new protocol feature we conduct thorough internal checks and testing. Our intention from the start was to conduct more external audits as we continue to build the protocol to ensure that QiDao is as safe as possible for its users.\nPrevious work done by Cloakwire:\nCloakwire has specialized in finance, critical infrastructure, transport, and crypto. The Cloakwire team has worked with companies such as Allegiant Airlines, Laclede, Carnival Cruise, Columbia Bank, Lufthansa, Altera, B&M Gates foundation, and some Berkshire companies. In specific to crypto and defi, their team has also worked with projects like Saber, Nitro Finance, Lido, and Skale. \nInformation about the Cloakwire team:\nThe members of their team that will review the smart contracts have done work for Quant Stamp and Hacken.\nCompany brochure\nThe full audit would cost 36,000 Qi to complete and would cover the following scope of work:  \nBest Practices Review\nCloakwire will review all existing security procedures, policies, and best practices established by QiDao with the objective of further enhancing governance by making improvements, additions, or adjustments where needed. \nSmart Contract Security Audit\nExhaustive testing methodologies will be applied to two (2) multi-collateral smart contracts to determine what security vulnerabilities may exist that could be exploited by attackers, resulting in a loss of funds. \nAdvanced Network Vulnerability Assessment (Internal and External)\nCloakwire will perform a series of scans employing the use of various custom or commercial tools to discover all systems and services in use by QiDao. The focus of this assessment will be to discover as many vulnerabilities as possible on all internal and external systems. Cloakwire will then validate all findings to ensure there are no false-positives, and finally offer suggestions for remediation or improvement. \nScenario-Based Penetration Test\nCloakwire will perform a series of attacks against the target infrastructure in order to determine the effectiveness of Client security controls and alerting. These attacks will be from the perspective of an attacker attempting to fabricate situations through which they can obtain investor or user funds, or otherwise disrupt the usability of the systems and applications leveraged by investors or users.\nMotivation\n\nEnsure best security practices\nIdentify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited\nReduce protocol risk\n\nOptions:\nFor: Perform the security with Cloakwire for 36,000 Qi\nAgainst: Do not conduct the audit with Cloakwire for 36,000 Qi\nYour voting power is represented in Qi Powah.

QiDao could achieve this by lowering liquidation ratios.\nExample\nA user has $900 worth of tokens sitting in a QiDao vault\nWith a liquidation ratio of 150% the user would be allowed to borrow a maximum of $600 worth of MAI against their collateral\nWith a liquidation ratio of 120% the user would be allowed to borrow a maximum of $750 worth of MAI against their collateral\nWith the lower liquidation ratio the user can access more of the value of their tokens locked in a vault. \nCurrent liquidation ratios per collateral\n\nMATIC - 150%\nWETH - 150%\nLINK - 150%\nAAVE - 150%\nCRV - 150%\ncamwMATIC - 155%\ncamWETH - 155%\ncamAAVE - 155%\n\nQiDao current liquidation process:\nWhen vaults fall below the liquidation ratio, liquidators repay 50% of the vault’s debt and withdraw a portion of the locked collateral tokens as compensation so that the liquidator gets a ~10% gain. The vault is then returned to the original vault owner at a healthy collateral to debt ratio. More info can be found at https://docs.mai.finance/liquidation\nRisk\nBlack swan events occur when prices of assets fall at very rapid rates. Lowering the liquidation ratio could decrease the collateral cushion that keeps MAI overcollateralized. We note that QiDao has experienced one historic black swan event in May as well as several market downturns throughout the past few weeks. During those events, liquidations functioned smoothly, and no vaults fell near 100%.\nHow would we combat the risks?\nBelow are some mitigants to the risk of lower liquidation ratios to 120% that could be implemented.\n\nEnsure liquidator rewards are still worth it to encourage quick liquidations. Liquidations have been very effective so far. We have now been through multiple black swan events and liquidations worked extremely well through those events\n\nImplement a stability pool to manage liquidation (subject to community discussion). This stability pool would be protocol run to ensure that vaults would be liquidated quickly when falling below the determined liquidation ratio. This would ensure that any risky vaults are liquidated quickly \n\nUse protocol treasury as an insurance policy in the case of MAI becoming undercollateralized \n\n\nCompetitive analysis on Polygon\nPolyquity - Liquidation ratio 110%\n\nAave - Risk Parameters - Risk \n100% / LTV = Collateral to Debt\n\nMotivation\n\nIncrease protocol’s capital efficiency without materially raising protocol risk\nMaintaining the competitiveness of the protocol\nAttract new users to borrow MAI through vaults\n\nOption #1 \nLower minimum liquidation ratio to 120% for non-stablecoin collaterals\nOption #2:\nMaintain minimum 150% liquidation ratio for non-stablecoin collaterals (no change)\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\n66.59%\n\n\nOption 2\n33.41%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0017-qip_018__adding_usdc_swap_fees_to_revenue_distribution.html":{"url":"proposals/0017-qip_018__adding_usdc_swap_fees_to_revenue_distribution.html","title":"QIP 018: Adding USDC Swap fees to Revenue Distribution","keywords":"","body":"QIP 018: Adding USDC Swap fees to Revenue Distribution\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-08-12T02:00:00.000Z\n2021-08-15T02:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nSummary:\nHow might we better reward current Qi stakers and increase the demand for Qi?\nThe protocol's largest revenue stream comes from USDC Swap fees. When users use the Swap they pay a 1% fee.\nThis is a proposal to distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers. Since the USDC swap was implemented (week 5) it has generated an average of $180,000 per week in revenues for the protocol.\nCurrent Qi staking rewards\nQi stakers currently receive:\n\n30% of weekly repayment fee revenue (plus a 25% boost) \n100% of LP rewards received from using deposit fee revenue to farm QI-MAI on QuickSwap.\n\nWhat is the USDC Swap?\nThe Swap allows users to swap USDC for MAI and MAI for USDC. The price to buy MAI sets a price ceiling of $1.01 and the price to sell MAI sets a price floor of $0.99. The price of MAI should trend close to $1, given that MAI can only repay $1 worth of debt. The ceiling and floor on its price keeps it from diverging from its peg too much.\nIf you would like to read more about the inner workings of the USDC Swap please read : https://docs.mai.finance/stablecoin-economics#usdc-swap\nMotivation:\n\nReturn more value to our loyal supporters\nEncourage more Qi holders to lock Qi\nIncrease demand for Qi\n\nOptions\nOption 1: Distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers\nOption 2: Do not distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\n99.50%\n\n\nOption 2\n0.50%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0018-qip_019__adding_other_stablecoins_to_the_swap__new_name__anchor__.html":{"url":"proposals/0018-qip_019__adding_other_stablecoins_to_the_swap__new_name__anchor__.html","title":"QIP 019: Adding other stablecoins to the Swap (New name: Anchor) ","keywords":"","body":"QIP 019: Adding other stablecoins to the Swap (New name: Anchor) \n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-08-12T03:00:00.000Z\n2021-08-16T03:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal is to add additional stablecoins to Anchor to mint MAI. The proposed stablecoins to add are USDT and DAI. Currently, Anchor only allows users to mint MAI with USDC. Minting through Anchor currently incurs a 1% fee.\nAnchor is a protocol mechanism that helps MAI maintain its peg. Anchor ensures that there is always MAI-USDC liquidity at a price that is close to the peg. This allows users to be able to repay their loans at close to $1 even if the price of MAI deviates from the peg on the open market. If you would like to read more about the inner workings of the USDC Swap (Anchor) please read : https://docs.mai.finance/stablecoin-economics#usdc-swap \nIf the proposed stablecoins are added to Anchor, users would be able mint MAI with USDT and DAI for a 1% fee. \nUSDT and DAI are the largest stablecoins in terms of liquidity, along with USDC. They are both in Curve’s base stablecoin pool, which speaks to their stability. USDT and DAI are also listed on Aave.\nLiquidity on Polygon:\nUSDT liquidity:\n\nAave: $175,873,203\nCurve: $108,915,747\nQuickSwap: $84,656,942\nSushi: $45,405,840\nDFYN: $51,096,385\nBalancer: $8,460,795\nOthers: $79,623,505\n\nDAI liquidity:\n\nAave: $898,671,441\nCurve: $78,075,279\nQuickSwap: $31,197,240\nSushi: $30,607,884\nDFYN: $21,530,421\nBalancer: $8,053,944\nOthers: $71,130,608\n\nMotivation:\n\nAdd options for QiDao users to mint MAI with their stablecoins at a fixed rate\nReduce the percent of MAI backed by one collateral type\n\nOptions:\n\nOption 1: Add USDT to Anchor \nOption 2: Add DAI to Anchor\nOption 3: Add both DAI and USDT to Anchor\nOption 4: Do not add USDT or DAI to Anchor\n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\n0.01%\n\n\nOption 2\n8.53%\n\n\nOption 3\n58.96%\n\n\nOption 4\n32.50%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0019-qip020__choosing_amms.html":{"url":"proposals/0019-qip020__choosing_amms.html","title":"QIP020: Choosing AMMs","keywords":"","body":"QIP020: Choosing AMMs\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-08-24T03:59:00.000Z\n2021-08-28T03:59:00.000Z\n\n\n\nPlease read the entire proposal before voting, as there are several factors to consider.\nSummary:\nOur current liquidity mining incentives on QuickSwap are scheduled to end on September 2nd. This proposal is for the community to decide whether or not we will extend liquidity mining incentives and if so on what AMM. The amount of rewards and what LPs to reward will be decided on a different proposal. \nThe liquidity mining rewards QiDao currently has on QuickSwap started on May 5th and were scheduled to last 120 days.

Please note that a follow up proposal will be submitted to discuss the amount of incentives QiDao would distribute and what LPs would be rewarded. The rewards period, if approved, will last 90 days. \nBelow are the offers QiDao has received from some of the top 5 AMMs on Polygon. The following offers are based on a scenario in which QiDao reduces their current rewards emission by half. If the community decides to reduce the current emissions by more than half, the committed rewards from the AMMs may vary. Note that our Balancer rewards will be covered in a separate proposal.\nQuickSwap:\nRewards committed (QuickSwap is doubling their current incentives for our pairs): \n\nStablecoin pool(s): 20 QUICK per day ($12.5k value per day).

In order to provide a competitive short-term option for borrowing MAI, QiDao would have to create a lending market for MAI with a floating interest rate. This would allow for a low cost option for loans under 2 months. Instead of launching a lending platform to create these markets, QiDao would like to partner with Market.xyz.\nLink to stablecoin market: https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/1\nLink to Market.xyz: https://polygon.market.xyz/\nWhat is Market.xyz?\nMarket.xyz is a platform that allows communities to launch isolated lending markets. These markets are controlled by an admin. In the case of this stablecoin market, it would be QiDao. Market.xyz was created from Rari Capital's code and was invested by the the founder of Rari Capital, Jai Bhavnani.\nSeed Amount:\nThe initial protocol market operation would inject 1 million MAI into the lending market. The act of borrowing MAI from this market would mint MAI with accepted collateral. The protocol would continually adjust the amount of MAI provided to the market in response to supply and demand.\nAll interest fees earned from the protocol providing MAI will be returned to the DAO.\nMotivation:\n\nAllow for a short-term borrowing option for MAI using fluctuating interest rates as opposed to a fixed repayment fee\nIncrease the amount of MAI in circulation\nIntroduce a new yield opportunity for long-term MAI borrowers\nQiDao would not have to build or maintain a new protocol to start a lending market\n\nQuorum Standards:\nThe option with the most votes will be chosen.\nOptions:\n\nPartner with Market.xyz\nDo not partner with Market.xyz\nFurther discussions needed\n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nPartner with Market.xyz\n99.83%\n\n\nDo not partner with Market.xyz\n0.04%\n\n\nFurther discussions needed\n0.13%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0027-qip028__expanding_qidao_to_other_chains.html":{"url":"proposals/0027-qip028__expanding_qidao_to_other_chains.html","title":"QIP028: Expanding QiDao to other chains","keywords":"","body":"QIP028: Expanding QiDao to other chains\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-10-11T07:00:00.000Z\n2021-10-14T07:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nThis proposal is to decide whether to expand MAI lending to other chains.\nIn the past few months, QiDao has become the largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon.

It's value increased steadily since it's introduction and legacy carbon markets are already accepting BCTs price signal for offline OTC trading of carbon offsets.\nAs the green committee's first initiative, we propose that 100% of weekly profits will be used to purchase BCTs. We will use the BCT to build a green treasury to further leverage upcoming green initiatives. \nTo demonstrate our commitment to climate action, we propose to properly burn portions of the BCT once Toucan's burn function is in place.\nThe DAO can vote on the amount of BCT to be burned. The Green Committee advocates a 50% burn rate. Assuming a 20% APY on the GLL, a BCT price of $7.7, and a time frame of 3 months, this gives a total of about 3000 tons of carbon offset and another 3000 BCT to use for future incentives. \nShowing that monetary profits are not the sole goal of QiDao will help put us at the center of ReFi and manifest MAI as the defacto green stable coin. \nThe reach of this first step will also help us improve our reputation in the fast growing green communities such as Klima & Toucan protocol, bringing positive network for future vaults.\nMotivation\n\nPosition QiDao in the center of the upcoming ReFi movement \nManifest MAI as the defacto green stable-coin\nBuild reputation as a DAO taking action on climate change \n\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\nOptions\n\nUse GLLP to buy BCT and burn 50%: half of the BCT bought will be burned and the other half will be retained in the DAO\nUse GLLP to buy BCT and not burn: all BCT bought will be retained in the DAO\nDo not buy BCT\n\nGLLP = Green Leverage Locker profit\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nUse GLLP to buy BCT & burn 50%\n19.17%\n\n\nUse GLLP to buy BCT & not burn\n56.51%\n\n\nDo not buy BCT\n24.31%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0041-qip042__add_tidal_insurance_coverage_for_qidao.html":{"url":"proposals/0041-qip042__add_tidal_insurance_coverage_for_qidao.html","title":"QIP042: Add Tidal Insurance Coverage for QiDao","keywords":"","body":"QIP042: Add Tidal Insurance Coverage for QiDao\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-11-30T11:00:00.000Z\n2021-12-05T11:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nAdding safety measures has been a top priority for QiDao. We are excited to share a proposal from Tidal Finance to add insurance coverage for the project as well as our end users.\nTidal is a Polygon-native insurance protocol that helps other projects protect against smart contract exploitations. Tidal will help us to bootstrap USDC as insurance collateral on its platform. USDC depositors will earn the premium fees from our payment, as well as TIDAL tokens.\nSince Tidal is also a Polygon ecosystem assigned insurance provider, the Polygon ecosystem fund is willing to contribute additional MATIC tokens (10k USD value) to incentivize a high quality native projects’ reserve pool. Mai.Finance would be able to receive this extra benefit.\nOnce our insurance reserve pool is launched, we can subscribe to the coverage plan by setting up the desired coverage amount. No upfront costs or long term contracts required, and the coverage plan is automatically extended on a weekly basis, as long as there is enough balance in the payment account.\nPayment can be made in USDC or QI, on Polygon, offering a useful utility for QI token holders. \nPartnership details\nTidal will incentivize Mai Finance’s reserve pool by allocating 475,000 TIDAL weekly (~ 4,500 USD value at current price). The allocation could gradually go down as more projects get onboarded, but the average weekly incentive would be 300,000 TIDAL for at least 6 months. (the reward will continue after 6 months also, will have a more accurate estimate as we get closer)\nAdditionally, ~600 MATIC tokens (1,000 USD value at current price) will be used to incentivize MAI’s reserve pool for 10 weeks.\nWe can start with a 1 million coverage plan. Cost for 1 million is 5% yearly, 0.1% weekly, $961 per week, paid from our treasury. At the same time, $500,000 coverage is available for our end users to purchase with either USDC or QI.\nNo long term commitments are needed, the coverage amount can be adjusted up or down, or canceled at any time, depending on our community feedback and adoption.\nThe insurance covers hacks that happen to QiDao smart contracts, but does not cover the loss due to a 3rd party protocol.\nLink to Tidal: https://tidal.finance/\nMotivation\n\nIncrease user safety.\nDrive user growth and TVL.\nAdd token utility.\n\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\nOptions\n\nAdd Tidal insurance coverage\nFurther discussion needed\n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAdd Tidal insurance coverage\n96.32%\n\n\nFurther discussion needed\n3.68%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0042-qip043__extend_quickswap_rewards.html":{"url":"proposals/0042-qip043__extend_quickswap_rewards.html","title":"QIP043: Extend QuickSwap Rewards","keywords":"","body":"QIP043: Extend QuickSwap Rewards\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-03T16:59:00.000Z\n2021-12-07T16:59:00.000Z\n\n\n\nThis proposal is to decide on whether to extend QuickSwap liquidity mining rewards for QI and MAI liquidity.\nThe team is currently allocating considerable time to new developments, including Qi bonding, new vaults, and new chain deployments.

The cxTokens have been adopted by QiDao, and now we are requesting the listing of Celsius’s native token, CEL.\nCEL is a top 100 market cap token with a $1bn+ market cap. CEL token has a fixed supply cap and a deflationary monetary policy. Celsius purchases CEL from the open market to pay rewards to its community, putting consistent buy-pressure on CEL. In addition, the CEL token has a weekly burning mechanism. Celsius is launching several initiatives to increase utility and adoption for CEL token, including a CelsiusX partnership with QiDao and other Polygon DeFi protocols to incubate liquidity. \nCelsiusX would love to partner with QiDao to adopt CEL tokens as collateral for MAI. We believe this will create utility and adoption for both parties - increasing the liquidity and collateral types for MAI (as the premier stablecoin on Polygon) and for CEL token by bringing it into DeFi and creating liquidity and use cases.\nProposal details\n\nThe Celsius community, over time, would deposit $3-5mm+ CEL token collateral into QiDao to mint MAI\nThe initial MAI minted will be used to provide stablecoin liquidity on AMMs as well as other MAI lending opportunities\nThis would create opportunities for the Celsius and CelsiusX community (1.5mm+ users on the Celsius platform) to use the native CEL token in DeFi on Polygon\n\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. \nA weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe options to add CEL token collectively outweigh the option to not add CEL\nThe option to not add CEL tokens receives fewer votes than any option to add CEL \n\nOptions\n\nAdd CEL at 130% min CDR\nAdd CEL at 135% min CDR\nAdd CEL at 140% min CDR\nFurther discussion needed\n\n*min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio\nLinks to CEL Information:\n\n2018 ICO $50mm Raise: https://icodrops.com/celsius/\nRank #80 on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token\nCEL weekly buy & burn: https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork/status/1504877945722134531?s=20&t=ln9hOcK_DnDapV_BKpT7Ow \n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAdd CEL at 130% min CDR\n1.18%\n\n\nAdd CEL at 135% min CDR\n87.17%\n\n\nAdd CEL at 140% min CDR\n11.06%\n\n\nFurther discussions needed\n0.59%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0083-qip082__choose_minimum_collateral_to_debt_ratio_for_sand.html":{"url":"proposals/0083-qip082__choose_minimum_collateral_to_debt_ratio_for_sand.html","title":"QIP082: Choose Minimum Collateral to Debt Ratio for SAND","keywords":"","body":"QIP082: Choose Minimum Collateral to Debt Ratio for SAND\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2022-04-03T14:04:38.000Z\n2022-04-06T03:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nSAND and its derivatives have already been approved as collateral for MAI.

This proposal aims to add xxDai as a collateral option for minting MAI.\nRisks and Benefits\nTetu’s xxDai strategy is an autompounding version of Tetu's xDai, which itself uses a vault feature the Tetu protocol calls Strategy Splitter. The Strategy Splitter, or Splitter for short, allows for the implementation of multiple strategies to generate yield on the underlying Dai across multiple platforms, reducing yield volatility and boosting returns. On Polygon, this strategy leverages Impermax and Aave, and developers have proposed adding Market.xyz, a protocol with which members of the QiDao community should be familiar as it is currently used to leverage borrowing of partner protocols’ tokens which do not currently have a Chainlink oracle and are therefore disqualified from being used as collateral to mint Mai. \nThe Tetu team has shown to be open to community suggestions on other potential destinations for the Splitter, including Aave v3.More information on Strategy Splitter can be found on Tetu’s Medium article on the subject.\nSee the xxDai Risk Assessment link located under Resources for a full list of risks and benefits.\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. A weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR (collateral to debt ratio) if the following conditions are met:\n• The options to add xxDai collectively outweigh the option to not add xxDai.\n• The option to not add xxDai receives more votes than any option to add xxDai.\nOptions\n• Add xxDai at 110% min CDR\n• Add xxDai at 120% min CDR\n• Add xxDai at 130% min CDR\n• Further discussion needed\nResources\n• xxDai Risk Assessment by @geekvine and @rob(ooor): https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/view/fcfbe14a268eff123778493e00a334cf/\n• xxDai Vault: https://app.tetu.io/vault/0xf52b3250e026e0307d7d717ae0f331baaa4f83a8\n• xxDai Contract: 0xf52B3250E026E0307d7d717AE0f331baAA4F83a8 \n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAdd xxDai at 110% min CDR\n59.48%\n\n\nAdd xxDai at 120% min CDR\n4.59%\n\n\nAdd xxDai at 130% min CDR\n1.38%\n\n\nFurther discussions needed\n34.55%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0102-qip102__add_yvusdc_as_collateral_for_mai.html":{"url":"proposals/0102-qip102__add_yvusdc_as_collateral_for_mai.html","title":"QIP102: Add yvUSDC as Collateral for MAI","keywords":"","body":"QIP102: Add yvUSDC as Collateral for MAI\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2022-05-16T16:00:11.000Z\n2022-05-19T16:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nyvUSDC (Yearn Vault USDC) is a USDC strategy on Yearn Finance.

See https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-move-control-of-price-oracle-to-governance-v2/3946/2 and https://compound.finance/docs/governance. Some platforms such as Liquity do not allow for changing the oracle at all.\nProposal\nVoting \"yes\" on this QIP directs the DAO to implement a small governance wrapper contract that will become the owner of the vaults. This wrapper contract should do the following:\n\nImplement a timelock in order to change the oracle address\nImplement a timelock in order to set the token peg\nRemove access to the transferToken(address to, address token, uint256 amountToken) function\nAllow for setting a new owner (for example, to upgrade the governance contract) but only with a timelock\n\nNew governance contract option (WIP): https://github.com/ajb/qidao-governance-contract/blob/main/src/QiVaultGovernance.sol\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\nOptions\n\nAccept proposal\nReject proposal\n\n\n\n\n\nChoices\nScore\n\n\n\n\nApprove proposal\n99.94%\n\n\nReject proposal\n0.06%\n\n\n\n"},"proposals/0133-qip133__dystopia_vedyst_round_9.html":{"url":"proposals/0133-qip133__dystopia_vedyst_round_9.html","title":"QIP133: Dystopia veDYST Round 9","keywords":"","body":"QIP133: Dystopia veDYST Round 9\n\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n2022-08-01T17:00:00.000Z\n2022-08-03T05:00:00.000Z\n\n\n\nThis proposal is to allocate QiDao’s voting power on Dystopia to pools with MAI and/or QI.\n500k votes will be used to vote for FRAX-MAI, given our partnership agreement with Frax Finance.
